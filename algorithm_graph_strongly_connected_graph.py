How to check whether the graph is strongly connected or not?
1. If a graph is undirected:
1-1 It is easy for undirected graph, we can just do a BFS and DFS starting from any vertex.
1-2 If BFS or DFS visits all vertices, then the given undirected graph is connected.

2. If a graph is directed:
2-1 A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between any two pair of vertices.
2-2 We cannot just use DFS or BFS to traverse it.

==> We have 3 solutions:
3-1 A simple idea is to use a all pair shortest path algorithm like Floyd Warshall or
find Transitive Closure of graph. Time complexity of this method would be O(v3).

3-2 We can also do DFS V times starting from every vertex. If any DFS,
doesnâ€™t visit all vertices, then graph is not strongly connected.
This algorithm takes O(V*(V+E)) time which can be same as transitive closure for a dense graph.

3-3 A better idea can be Strongly Connected Components (SCC) algorithm.
We can find all SCCs in O(V+E) time. If number of SCCs is one, then graph is strongly connected.
The algorithm for SCC does extra work as it finds all SCCs.

*** We use 3-2 as a solution over here ***
Time Complexity: O(V+E)
