in-place algorithm,
the definition of this is vary.

Some would say that the algorithm which only used the space of input data is called in-place.
EX: Quick Sort

However, an algorithm such as quick-sort would use recursion, which means we need to call stack frame,
stack frame is likely as a concept of space, so if stack frame is kind of extra space,
why could we say that quick sort is an in-place algorithm?

Therefore, there are two version about in-place algorithm!!!!!!!!!

It's all depend on you !!
